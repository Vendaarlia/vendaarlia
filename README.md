## Deskripsi Proyek: Vendaarlia's Everything and Anything Guild

Vendaarlia's Everything and Anything Guild is a portfolio website creation project that offers the unique experience of exploring a world of dungeons and parties controlled by a group of maniac scientists. Each page on this website represents part of a guild whose purpose is to manage a dungeon and party, with users identified as "travelers".

Built using Next.js technology, this project is a collaboration between mad scientists with extreme design and programming skills to achieve unique results that are different from other portfolio websites.

In the user's experience, each website page represents a room or part of a dungeon managed by a guild. Users are invited to explore each room and discover the creative works produced by the guild. Each piece has a strange and unique feel, reflecting design and programming experiments carried out by maniacal scientists.

As such, Vendaarlia's Everything and Anything Guild offers an engaging and entertaining experience for its visitors, while showcasing the creative portfolio of a talented group of mad scientists in design and programming.
